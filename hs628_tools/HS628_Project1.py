Prompt Questions:
    * What type of plot do you want to output?
        - Overall linear regression
        - Scatterplot
        - Bar plots of variables
        - Histogram
        - Correlation plot
        - Box plots

    * What is the x axis variables and title?
    * What is the y axis variable and title?
    * What is the title of the graph?
    * What color scheme?
    * What variable names do you want for your legend?
        - counts number of Xs and shows this:
            - Var 1 title:
            - Var 2 title:
            - ... etc ...

Functions:
    - Each type of plot with x and y variable input answers coded in 
    - Labeling the graph
        - inputs from x and y titles, overall title, legend x titles
        - color scheme
    - Something that includedes the answer from Q2 so that it can come up in Q3 and Q8
